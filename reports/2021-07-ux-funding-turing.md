## Proposal details

**How would you like to develop this project?**

Since The Turing Wayâ€™s launch in 2019, over 270 contributors have co-authored more than 150 subchapters describing data science practices on reproducible research, communication, collaboration, project design and research ethics.
The project is used by thousands of users each month and cited across different projects within and outside the Turing.
As the number of chapters continues to increase, it is important for us to offer appropriate ways for our users to discover relevant and desired content in the book based on their topics of interest and skill levels to ensure we maximise the accessibility, reusability, and therefore impact, of the resources created by data scientists and researchers.

We are proposing to use the additional funding to employ an experienced UI/UX designer, potentially from the Turing REG team, to develop features for the project that provides enhanced filtering or search functionality in the book, making it easier for the broad community of data science users to discover the content.
This proposal will directly enhance the project workflow, content management, community engagement and the overall interactivity in the book, by supporting the improved discovery of existing chapters and streamlining the addition of new or updated content in the future.
Newly developed features will be contributed upstream to the JupyterBook project, an open-source tool used by data scientists globally.

This work will be hugely important in ensuring the legacy and impact of a critical resource for data science and open research, which is already widely cited across multiple domains and influences research practices within the Turing as well as industry, government, and third-sector organisations, such as The Health Foundation.

We are particularly interested in projects that showcase:
1. data integration and/or model linking
2. good data science practice
3. effective visualisation and/or communication to stakeholders.

**How would the proposed project development highlight these areas?**

This proposal will focus on facilitating the adoption of good science practices (2) and effective communication of data science (3).
The Turing Way is an Open Source and community-led book project that involves and supports diverse stakeholders (such as researchers, funders, software engineers, funders, data stewards and project managers) in developing and sharing recommendations, guidance and best practices in data science.
These resources are available as an online book with five guides on reproducibility, project design, communication, collaboration and research ethics.
A community handbook is maintained to document and showcase how good practices are applied in the development of open source projects -- allowing anyone to develop a similar project in data science from scratch.
As a growing resource, we would like to invest in enhancing the user experience (UX/UI), especially for encouraging Turing researchers to discover relevant and desired content in the book based on the specific topic and research stage of their projects.

Without prior knowledge, new members with different levels of skills find it challenging to identify which chapters are useful for them or what topics have been covered by the current version of the book.
This makes the book hard to navigate for new and occasional readers and users of this book: the community members who could benefit the most from The Turing Way material.
The UX/UI development of the project will be supported by an experienced UX/UI designer (potentially from the Turing REG team) who will engage users and contributors of various skill levels in enhancing the discoverability of the resources that are immediately useful for them.
This effort will directly translate into (1) effective communication of The Turing Way resources on good practices that are applicable across different themes, and (2) increased engagement of researchers and data scientists with these practices by allowing them to quickly access the relevant concepts that they can integrate into their work.

**How would the proposed project development have cross-theme impact?**

The improvement in navigation and usability of the Turing Way guides will support increased cross-theme impact for the project beyond its current levels in several ways:
Discoverability of best practices: by removing barriers that can let the perfect be the enemy of the good and leave people feeling intimidated to engage.
Customising and curating the material for experts at any level from across academia, government, industry, third sector, educators and citizen scientists.
Contributions to upstream project JupyterBook mean that outputs from other projects across ASG can benefit from the investment in improving the communication of interactive code and analysis demonstrations.
In addition, The Turing Way has already formed part of the training of PhD candidates (enrichment students and engage @ Turing graduates) and onboarding for recent cohorts of ASG postdocs primarily working on the new cross-theme projects.
Improved usability of the guides will support the adoption of best practices across the CTPs and in doing so, reduce the barriers to effective collaboration across the cohort.
The proposed improvements to the workflow of the project will take the needs of ASG researchers into account by involving them in the development process.
This will encourage and enable improved engagement and dissemination of tools, practices and case studies generated by ASG projects.
This will have an additional benefit of supporting the production of planned position papers through the collation of experiences and best practices from across the ASG programme, conducted by the ASG Community Manager and Research Application Managers working alongside the Turing Way Community Manager.    

**What resources are needed for the project development? (approximately)**

We intend to work with an experienced UX/UI designer to work on the user experience of The Turing Way by presenting its resources in an intuitive format that is accessible to wider user groups.
This can be achieved by allocating staff time of a Research Software Engineer from the Turing REG team (0.5 person time for 6 months), however, we will be open to hiring an external contractor if needed.
The UX/UI expert (REG member) will be supervised and mentored by The Turing Way community manager (0.2 person time for 6 months), as well as the applicants of this proposal.

**Do you have someone in mind to conduct this work?**

For REG resources, the start time will depend on the outcome of the resource allocation process if funding is successful.

**If you do not have someone in mind to conduct this work, what person specification requirements would be needed to develop the project?**

In addition to the response for the Q8, we want to note that a community manager will be hired to manage and develop The Turing Way project independent of this proposal.
